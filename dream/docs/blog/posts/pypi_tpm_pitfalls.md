# Pypi Trusted Publisher Management and pitfalls

![security pipeline](images/pypi_tpm/pypi_tpm_image.png){ style="height:300px" align=right}
Be the cool kid on pypi, I thought, use the Trusted Publisher Management and OpenID Connect (OIDC)... I thought...

While working on my latest repo [convert_poetry2uv](https://pypi.org/project/convert-poetry2uv/), I wanted to automatically push the builds to pypi. Traditionally a username/password combination was used, which was later replaced by an API token. These days OIDC can be used, which I tried. I'm here to share some pitfalls, so hopefully you don't fall in them.

## The beginning
Let's start with the guides I followed:

[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
)

This is actually quite clear and will get you started quickly, with also good examples. I only changed the actions yaml a bit, to work with uv.

Another doc is by [pypi](https://pypi.org), [https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/)

So, let's start with which field needs to be what.

This is what is currently being used for my test flow, to push to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org).

## Any caveats?

So what are the caveats, this looks simple enough, right?

### Typos
obviously!

### Project name
The next thing is the PyPi *Project Name*. This needs to match the name defined in your `pyproject.toml` (no underscore, but hyphens!). If it doesn't match you'll get 403 errors when trying to upload.

```html title="403 error"
  <title>403 Invalid API Token: OIDC scoped token is not valid for
    project 'poetry-to-uv', project-scoped token is not valid for project:
    'poetry-to-uv'</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>403 Invalid API Token: OIDC scoped token is not valid for project
    'poetry-to-uv', project-scoped token is not valid for project:
    'poetry-to-uv'</h1>
      Access was denied to this resource.<br/><br/>
    Invalid API Token: OIDC scoped token is not valid for project
    &#x27;poetry-to-uv&#x27;, project-scoped token is not valid for
    project: &#x27;poetry-to-uv&#x27;
```

> NOTE: this error still has the old project name, which was part of my original challenge

### "-" vs "_"
During my initial steps I also ran into a invalid-publisher. This is described on the [troubleshooting page](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/troubleshooting/).

In my case, this was a mismatch between "_" and "-".

### Not a problem
Having a *repository name* different than the *project name* is not a problem, as long as they are specified correctly on the [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) publishing page.

## Example highlights

At the bottom of this article is my complete `publish-to-pypi.yml` workflow.

Here are some highlight on the snippets.

```markdown title="environment"
 publish-to-testpypi:
    name: Upload release to TestPyPI
    needs:
      - build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    environment:
      name: testpypi
      url: https://test.pypi.org/p/convert-poetry2uv
```

Note the name of the environment, it matches the environment that is configured in the publisher on pypi.org.

```markdown title="repository-url"
 - name: Publish distribution 📦 to TestPyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
          verbose: true
          skip-existing: true
```

For TestPyPi the *repository-url* needs to be set. I've set the *verbose* to true, so I was able to inspect my issues. The *skip-existing* flag is useful for testing on TestPyPi. It will not overwrite the existing file with the same version number, but it will not fail the pipeline either.


## Full example
For the full section below.

* Only push to pypi when a new tag is set

```markdown title="publish-to-pypi"
  publish-to-pypi:
    name: Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to PyPI
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') # only publish to PyPI on tag pushes
```

* ${{ github.token }}, is automatically set. No need to worry about it.

```markdown
 - name: Create GitHub Release
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

* With the upload to pypi successful, a release is created also on github.
